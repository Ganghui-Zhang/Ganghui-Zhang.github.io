Abstract: We present and analyze three distinct semidiscrete schemes for solving nonlocal geometric flows incorporating perimeter terms. These schemes are based on the finite difference method, the finite element method and the finite element method with a specific tangential motion. We offer rigorous proofs of quadratic convergence under 
$H^1$-norm for the first scheme and linear convergence under 
$H^1$--norm for the latter two schemes. All error estimates rely on the observation that the error of the nonlocal term can be controlled by the error of the local term. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between the convergence under 
$L^\infty$--norm and manifold distance. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the convergence analysis, and demonstrate the accuracy of our schemes under various norms for different types of nonlocal flows.
