Abstract: We present a novel parametric finite element approach for simulating the surface diffusion of curves and surfaces. Our core strategy incorporates a predictor-corrector time-stepping method, which enhances the classical first-order temporal accuracy to achieve second-order accuracy. Notably, our new method eliminates the necessity for mesh regularization techniques, setting it apart from previously proposed second-order schemes by the authors (W. Jiang et al. (2024) [31]). Moreover, it maintains the long-term mesh equidistribution property characteristic of the first-order scheme. The proposed techniques are readily adaptable to other geometric flows, such as (area-preserving) curve shortening flow and surface diffusion with anisotropic surface energy. Comprehensive numerical experiments have been conducted to validate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed methods, demonstrating their superiority over previous schemes.
