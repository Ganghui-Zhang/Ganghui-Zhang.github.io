I am a Computational mathematics researcher. My research interests focus on numerical analysis and scientific computing for geometric partial differential equations.

I obtained my PhD from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. [Chunmei Su](http://www.chunmei-su.cn/).

I am now a postdoctoral research assistant at the Department of Mathematics, University of Edinburgh, mentored by Dr. [Kaibo Hu](https://kaibohu.github.io/).

I grew up in Ningbo and Hangzhou, China, and have since lived in Jinan, Beijing, Regensburg, and Edinburgh.
